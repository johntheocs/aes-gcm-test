[Ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) is a wonderful library of crypto in Rust. However, there are not many examples on how to use it for even simple tasks.

Found this artile ["Authenticated Encryption in Rust using Ring"](https://web3developer.io/authenticated-encryption-in-rust-using-ring/) online on how to use it encrypt and decrypt data using AES-GCM-256 algorithm.
